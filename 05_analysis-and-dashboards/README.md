# 05 – Analysis & Dashboards

This part of the project focuses on transforming GA4 event exports into meaningful business insights for the Siete Padel shop.

Objectives:

- Reconstruct a simple e-commerce funnel  
- Calculate conversion rates between `view_item`, `add_to_cart`, `begin_checkout`, and `purchase`  
- Define initial KPI metrics tailored to a small padel e-commerce store  

Planned deliverables:

- Jupyter Notebook containing data transformations and analysis logic based on the exported CSV files  
- Funnel visualizations with drop-off indicators  
- Clear documentation of key performance metrics (e.g. CVR, AOV, Cart Rate)  
- Dashboard proposals for future implementation in Looker Studio or similar tools

Focus areas:

- Where users leave the funnel
- Which product types generate the most engagement
- First meaningful signals despite low-traffic test environment
